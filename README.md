# FieteLab-RIBP

## Setup

After cloning the repository, create a virtual environment for Python 3:

`python3 -m venv ribp`

Then activate the virtual environment:

`source ribp/bin/activate`

Ensure pip is up to date:

`pip install --upgrade pip`

Then install the required packages:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

We did not test Python2, but Python2 may work.
